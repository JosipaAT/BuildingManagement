# BuildingManagement

Building  Management  web  application was created as a bachelor thesis. The app is used by the building management company,
owners of apartments and  representatives of building co-owners.  
The application allows users to review the information within their authority, and to  create reports based on it. 
Bootstrap  and  Thymeleaf  were  used  to  create  the  web  application  interface.  
Java  programming language with the IntelliJ code editor and the Spring  Boot tool were used to  create the background part of the application. 
As a database management tool, MySQL was  used.
